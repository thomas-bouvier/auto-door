        <h1>Auto-door</h1>
        <p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li><li>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</li><li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
        <p>Ye-ha! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li><li>I call it luck.</li><li>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</li>
        </ul>
